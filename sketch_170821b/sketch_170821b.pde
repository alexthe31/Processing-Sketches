  // 8. Make steps 6 and 9 happen only if the mouse is pressed.
 
 // 9.  Redraw you background so only one moustache appears at a time

  // 6. Add the mustache using this code: image(mustache, 400,  300);
image(mustache, 400,  300);
  // 7. Change the line above so that the mustache moves with the mouse.

  // 10. [optional] You might want to adjust mouseX and mouseY so that your tash is drawn exactly where the mouse is clicked.
  
  // 12. [optional] Draw a hat on your friends when the right mouse button is clicked: if (mouseButton == RIGHT){}
